    The main loop of the machine learning process

    This loop is run in a separate process, and communicates with the game process.

    Note that the game process won't wait for the ml process to generate the
    GameInstruction. It is possible that the frame of the GameInstruction
    is behind of the current frame in the game process. Try to decrease the fps
